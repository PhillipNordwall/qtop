qtop.py / The command-line tool to tame queueing or scheduling systems and some more

Version 0.8.4 / November 12, 2015

Ported in Python by Sotiris Fragkiskos / Originally created in bash by Fotis Georgatos

Summary:
qtop is a work-in-progress project; it is intended to be built upon and extended.

We have made an initial release of the source code, and continue to work 
actively to make it better. We hope to build an active open source community 
that drives the future of this tool, both by providing feedback 
and by actively contributing to the source code.

This program is currently in development and highly experimental. If it works, peace :)
